# CSES Sheet 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to the **CSES Problem Set** — each written with
clear intuition, structured approach, and time/space complexity analysis.  
I maintain this as a **learning journal** and a **revision resource** for competitive programming.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong algorithmic problem-solving skills  
- Develop clear and structured thinking for CP problems  
- Document thought process (not just final code)  
- Identify patterns across different problem types  
- Keep solutions clean, readable, and optimized

## 📌 About CSES Problem Set

The **CSES Problem Set** is a high-quality collection of algorithmic problems designed to:
- Strengthen fundamentals of data structures and algorithms  
- Improve speed and accuracy for competitive programming  
- Prepare for coding interviews and contests  

It covers topics ranging from basics to advanced techniques.

## 🧠 Solution Format

For every problem, I try to include:

1. **Problem summary (in my own words)**  
2. **Intuition — the key idea behind the solution**  
3. **Step-by-step approach**  
4. **Time and space complexity analysis**  
5. **Final optimized implementation**

The goal is to **understand patterns**, not memorize solutions.

## 🛠 Language

- **C++** (with emphasis on clean syntax, STL usage, and optimal performance)

## 🤝 Contributing

This repository is mainly for my personal learning.  
Suggestions, optimizations, and alternative approaches are always welcome — feel free to open an issue or discussion.

---

## 💡 Notes

Some solutions may include:
- Multiple approaches (brute force → optimized)  
- Important edge cases  
- Conceptual insights  
- References to related problems  

I regularly revisit older solutions to refactor and improve them as I learn better techniques.
